<h1>HOW CAN YOU HELP?</h1>

<span></span>

    <p>
    A Charity is an organisation that exists to enable one group of people to help another. It can sometimes be for animals or nature. Many of the best known charities were set up by people who felt passionate about a situation that they believed was wrong or preventable!
    <br />   <h5> So how do charities use their money? </h5>   Charities usually need money for three things. Firstly, the largest part of any donation goes to the cause or group for which it was given (usually around 80%) this will pay for the people, food, medicines, clothes, etc.
    YOU can start by giving out some masks, vitamins, etc to affected areas.
